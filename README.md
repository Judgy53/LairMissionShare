# LairMissionShare
Add commands to automate Lair Missions sharing.

# Installation
Unzip to `Secret World Legends` folder. 

`Data` folder contains the addon itself and is necessary. 

`Scripts` folder is however optional, but makes it easier to use.

# Commands
`/option LairMissionShare <true|false>` Enable or disable the addon. (Default : `true`)

`/option LMS_ShareOnce true` Share all lair missions once.

`/option LMS_ShareLoop <true|false>` Set to `true` to start a loop which shares missions every 5 seconds. Set to `false` to stop it.

# Aliases
If you installed the `Scripts` folder, you have access to aliases (easier to remember and use)

`/lms` Share all lair missions once.

`/lms_start` Start a loop which shares missions every 5 seconds.

`/lms_stop` Stop the share loop.

You can rename the scripts file in `Secret World Legends/Scripts` if you want.
